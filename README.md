# Initial REAMDE

This is the repo for ndom91's common scripts. They're generally not super advanced, but definitely save me a lot of time and I hope the can maybe do that for others as well!

The plex scripts mov_adv.sh and tv_adv.sh are legitimately advanced took a lot of hard work. Those are maybe work actually checking out!
